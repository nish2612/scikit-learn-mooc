# # üìù Exercise M4.01
#
# The aim of this exercise is two-fold:
#
# * understand the parametrization of a linear model;
# * quantify the fitting accuracy of a set of such models.
#
# We will reuse part of the code of the course to:
#
# * load data;
# * create the function representing a linear model.
#
# ## Prerequisites
#
# ### Data loading

# ```{note}
# If you want a deeper overview regarding this dataset, you can refer to the
# Appendix - Datasets description section at the end of this MOOC.
# ```

feature_name = "Flipper Length (mm)"
target_name = "Body Mass (g)"
data, target = penguins[[feature_name]], penguins[target_name]

# ## Main exercise
#
# Given a vector of the flipper length, several weights and intercepts to
# plot several linear model that could fit our data. Use the above
# helper function to visualize both the model and data.

# %%
import numpy as np

flipper_length_range = np.linspace(data.min(), data.max(), num=300)

# %%
# Write your code here.
 weights = [40,50,-30]
intercepts = [12000,500,-5000]
import seaborn as sns
ax=sns.scatterplot(data=penguins,x='feature_name',y=target_name,color=balck,alpha=0.5)
label = "{0:.2f} (g / mm) * flipper length + {1:.2f} (g)"
for weight ,interceps in zip(weights,intercepts):
    predicted_body_mass=linear_model_flipper_mass(flipper_length_range,weight,intercept)
    ax.plot(flipper_length_range,predicted_body_mass,label=label.format(weight,intercept))


# %% [markdown]
# In the previous question, you were asked to create several linear models.
# The visualization allowed you to qualitatively assess if a model was better
# than another.
#
# Now, you should come up with a quantitative measure which will indicate the
# goodness of fit of each linear model. This quantitative metric should result
# in a single scalar and allow you to pick up the best model.


# %%

    errors=np.ravel(true_values)-np.ravel(predictions)
    # Define a measure indicating the goodness of fit of a model given the true
    # values and the model predictions.
   return np.mean(np.abs(errors))


# %%
# Uncomment the code below.

     print(f"{weight:.2f} (g / mm) * flipper length + {intercept:.2f} (g)")
